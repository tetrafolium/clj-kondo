## Introduction

Clj-kondo can be configured in five ways, by providing:

- home dir config in `~/.config/clj-kondo/config.edn` (respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
- project config: a `config.edn` file in the `.clj-kondo` directory (see
  [project setup](../README.md#project-setup))
- `:config-paths` in project `config.edn`: a list of directories that provide additional config
- command line `--config` file or EDN arguments
- namespace local config using `:clj-kondo/config` metadata in the namespace form

The configurations are merged in the following order, where a later config overrides an earlier config:

- home dir config
- `:config-paths` in project config
- project config
- command line config
- namespace local config

The `^:replace` metadata hint can be used to replace parts or all of the
configuration instead of merging with previous ones. The home dir config is
implicitly part of `:config-paths`. To opt out of merging with home dir config
use `:config-paths ^:replace []` in your project config.

Note that namespace local config must always be quoted: `{:clj-kondo/config
'{:linters ...}}` and quotes should not appear inside the config.

Look at the [default configuration](../src/clj_kondo/impl/config.clj) for all
available options.

## Examples

See [examples](../examples) for library-specific configurations.

## Unrecognized macros

Clj-kondo only expands a selected set of macros from clojure.core and some
popular community libraries. For unrecognized macros you can use these
configurations:

- [`:lint-as`](#lint-a-custom-macro-like-a-built-in-macro)
- [`:unresolved-symbol`](#exclude-unresolved-symbols-from-being-reported)
- [`:hooks`](#hooks)

## Linters

### Disable a linter

``` shellsession
$ echo '(select-keys [:a])' | clj-kondo --lint -
<stdin>:1:1: error: wrong number of args (1) passed to clojure.core/select-keys
linting took 10ms, errors: 1, warnings: 0

$ echo '(select-keys [:a])' | clj-kondo --lint - --config '{:linters {:invalid-arity {:level :off}}}'
linting took 10ms, errors: 0, warnings: 0
```

### Enable optional linters

Some linters are not enabled by default. Right now these linters are:

- `:missing-docstring`: warn when public var doesn't have a docstring.
- `:unsorted-required-namespaces`: warn when namespaces in `:require` are not sorted.
- `:refer`: warn when there is **any** usage of `:refer` in your namespace requires.
- `:single-key-in`: warn when using assoc-in, update-in or get-in with single key

You can enable these linters by setting the `:level`:

``` clojure
{:linters {:missing-docstring {:level :warning}}}
```

### Disable all linters but one

You can accomplish this by using `^:replace` metadata, which will override
instead of merge with other configurations:

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint corpus --config '^:replace {:linters {:redundant-let {:level :info}}}'
corpus/redundant_let.clj:4:3: info: redundant let
corpus/redundant_let.clj:8:3: info: redundant let
corpus/redundant_let.clj:12:3: info: redundant let
```

### Ignore warnings in an expression

To ignore all warnings in an expression, place a hint before it. It uses reader
comments, so they won't end up in your runtime.

``` clojure
#_:clj-kondo/ignore
(inc 1 2 3)
```

To ignore warnings from just one or a few linters:

``` clojure
#_{:clj-kondo/ignore [:invalid-arity]}
(inc 1 2 3)
```

### Enable optional linters


### Lint a custom macro like a built-in macro

In the following code the `my-defn` macro is defined, but clj-kondo doesn't know how to interpret it:

``` clojure
(ns foo)

(defmacro my-defn [name args & body]
  `(defn ~name ~args
     (do (println "hello!")
       ~@body)))

(my-defn foo [x])
```

Hence `(foo 1 2 3)` will not lead to an invalid arity error. However, the syntax
of `my-defn` is a subset of `clojure.core/defn`, so for detecting arity errors
we might have just linted it like that. That is what the following configuration accomplishes:

``` clojure
{:lint-as {foo/my-defn clojure.core/defn}}
```

When you have custom `def` or `defn`-like macros and you can't find a supported macro that is like it, you can use:

``` clojure
{:lint-as {foo/my-defn clj-kondo.lint-as/def-catch-all}}
```

### Exclude unresolved symbols from being reported

In the following code `streams` is a macro that assigns a special meaning to the symbol `where`, so it should not be reported as an unresolved symbol:

``` clojure
(ns foo
  (:require [riemann.streams :refer [streams]]))

(def email (mailer {:host "mail.relay"
                    :from "riemann@example.com"}))
(streams
  (where (and (= (:service event) “my-service”)
              (= (:level event) “ERROR”))
    ,,,))
```

This is the config for it:

``` clojure
{:linters
  {:unresolved-symbol
    {:exclude [(riemann.streams/streams [where])]}}}
```

To exclude all symbols in calls to `riemann.streams/streams` write `:exclude [(riemann.streams/streams)]`, without the vector.

To exclude a symbol from being reported as unresolved globally in your project, e.g. `foo`, you can use `:exclude [foo]`.

Sometimes vars are introduced by executing macros, e.g. when using [HugSQL](https://github.com/layerware/hugsql)'s `def-db-fns`. You can suppress warnings about these vars by using `declare`. Example:

``` clojure
(ns hugsql-example
  (:require [hugsql.core :as hugsql]))

(declare select-things)

;; this will define a var #'select-things:
(hugsql/def-db-fns "select_things.sql")

(defn get-my-things [conn params]
  (select-things conn params))
```

If the amount of symbols introduced by HugSQL becomes too unwieldy, consider
introducing a separate namespace in which HugSQL generates the vars:
`foo.db.hugsql`. You can then refer to this namespace from `foo.db` with
`(require '[foo.db.hugsql :as sql]) (sql/insert! ...)` and clj-kondo will not
complain about this.

Furthermore, the `:lint-as` option can help treating certain macros like
built-in ones. This is in clj-kondo's own config:

``` clojure
:lint-as {me.raynes.conch/programs clojure.core/declare
          me.raynes.conch/let-programs clojure.core/let}
```

and helps preventing false positive unresolved symbols in this code:

``` clojure
(ns foo (:require [me.raynes.conch :refer [programs let-programs]]))

(programs rm mkdir echo mv)
(let-programs [clj-kondo "./clj-kondo"]
  ,,,)
```

### Exclude unresolved namespaces from being reported

``` clojure
(ns foo
  {:clj-kondo/config '{:linters {:unresolved-namespace {:exclude [criterium.core]}}}})

(criterium.core/quick-bench [])
```

### Exclude arity linting inside a specific macro call

Some macros rewrite their arguments and therefore can cause false positive arity
errors. Imagine the following silly macro:

``` clojure
(ns silly-macros)

(defmacro with-map [m [fn & args]]
  `(~fn ~m ~@args))
```

which you can call like:

``` clojure
(silly-macros/with-map {:a 1 :d 2} (select-keys [:a :b :c])) ;;=> {:a 1}
```

Normally a call to this macro will give an invalid arity error for `(select-keys
[:a :b :c])`, but not when you use the following configuration:

``` clojure
{:linters {:invalid-arity {:skip-args [silly-macros/with-map]}}}
```

### Exclude required but unused namespace from being reported

In the following code, the namespaces `foo.specs` and `bar.specs` are only loaded for the side effect of registering specs, so we don't like clj-kondo reporting those namespaces as required but unused.

``` clojure
(ns foo (:require [foo.specs] [bar.specs]))
(defn my-fn [x] x)
```

That can be done using this config:

``` clojure
{:linters {:unused-namespace {:exclude [foo.specs bar.specs]}}}
```

A regex is also supported:

``` clojure
{:linters {:unused-namespace {:exclude [".*\\.specs$"]}}}
```

This will exclude all namespaces ending with `.specs`.

### Exclude unused referred vars from being reported.

Imagine you want to have `taoensso.timbre/debug` available in all of your
namespaces. Even when you don't use it, you don't want to get a warning about
it. That can be done as follows:

``` clojure
{:linters {:unused-referred-var {:exclude {taoensso.timbre [debug]}}}}
```

### Exclude deprecated var usage from being reported

Say you have the following function:

``` clojure
(ns app.foo)
(defn foo {:deprecated "1.9.0"} [])
```

and you still want to be able to call it without getting a warning, for example in function in the same namespace which is also deprecated:

``` clojure
(defn bar {:deprecated "1.9.0"} []
  (foo))
```

or in test code:

``` clojure
(ns app.foo-test
  (:require
   [app.foo :refer [foo]]
   [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]))

(deftest foo-test [] (is (nil? (foo))))
```

To achieve this, use this config:

``` clojure
{:linters
 {:deprecated-var
  {:exclude
   {app.foo/foo
    {:defs [app.foo/bar]
     :namespaces [app.foo-test]}}}}}
```

A regex is also permitted, e.g. to exclude all test namespaces:

``` clojure
{:linters {:deprecated-var {:exclude {app.foo/foo {:namespaces [".*-test$"]}}}}}
```

### Exclude unused bindings from being reported

To exclude unused bindings from being reported, start their names with
underscores: `_x`. To exclude warnings about key-destructured function arguments, use:

``` clojure
{:linters {:unused-binding {:exclude-destructured-keys-in-fn-args true}}}
```

Examples:

``` clojure
$ echo '(defn f [{:keys [:a :b :c]} d])' | clj-kondo --lint -
<stdin>:1:18: warning: unused binding a
<stdin>:1:21: warning: unused binding b
<stdin>:1:24: warning: unused binding c
<stdin>:1:29: warning: unused binding d
linting took 8ms, errors: 0, warnings: 4
```

``` clojure
$ echo '(defn f [{:keys [:a :b :c]} _d])' | clj-kondo --lint - --config \
  '{:linters {:unused-binding {:exclude-destructured-keys-in-fn-args true}}}'
linting took 8ms, errors: 0, warnings: 0
```

### Exclude unused private vars from being reported

Example code:

``` clojure
(ns foo) (defn- f [])
```

Example config:

``` clojure
{:linters {:unused-private-var {:exclude [foo/f]}}}
```

### Alias consistency

Sometimes it's desirable to have a consistent alias for certain namespaces in a project. E.g. in the below code it could be desirable if every alias for `old.api` was `old-api`:

``` clojure
(ns foo (:require [new.api :as api]))
(ns bar (:require [old.api :as old-api]))
(ns baz (:require [old.api :as api]))
```

This configuration:

``` clojure
{:linters {:consistent-alias {:aliases {old.api old-api}}}}
```

will give this warning:

``` clojure
Inconsistent alias. Expected old-api instead of api.
```

### Ignore the contents of comment forms

If you prefer not to lint the contents of `(comment ...)` forms, use this configuration:

```clojure
{:skip-comments true}
```

### Exclude namespace in `:refer-all` linter

```clojure
{:linters {:refer-all {:exclude [alda.core]}}}
```

## Hooks

Hooks are a way to enhance linting via user provided code.

### API

Hooks are interpreted using the [Small Clojure Interpreter](https://github.com/borkdude/sci).

Hooks receive Clojure code as rewrite-clj nodes, not only for performance reasons, but
also because rewrite-clj nodes carry the line and row numbers for every Clojure element.
Note that when we refer to a "rewrite-clj node", we are referring to clj-kondo's version of rewrite-clj node.
Clj-kondo's version of [rewrite-clj](https://github.com/xsc/rewrite-clj) is catered to its use case,
includes some bug fixes, but most notably: strips away all whitespace.

A hook can leverage the `clj-kondo.hooks-api` namespace for transformation and analysis of rewrite-clj nodes,
functions include:

- `list-node`: produce a new list node from a seqable of list nodes.
- `vector-node`: produce a new vector node from a seqable of list nodes.
- `token-node`: produce a new token node (symbol, keyword, etc) of a given token.
- `sexpr`: turns a node into a Clojure s-expression. Useful for analyzing or debugging.
- `reg-finding!`: registers a finding. Expects a map with:
  - `:message`: the lint message
  - `:row` and `:col`: the location of the finding. These values can be derived from the metadata of a node.
  - `:type`: the type of lint warning. A level must be set for this type in the
    clj-kondo config under `:linters`. If the level is not set, the lint warning
    is ignored.

The namespaces `clojure.core`, `clojure.set` and `clojure.string` are also available.

Hooks must be configured in clj-kondo's `config.edn` under `:hooks`, e.g.:

``` Clojure
{:hooks {:analyze-call {foo.weird-macro hooks.foo/weird-macro}}}
```

### analyze-call

The `analyze-call` hook offers a way to lint macros that are unrecognized by clj-kondo and cannot
be supported by [`:lint-as`](#lint-a-custom-macro-like-a-built-in-macro).

It receives Clojure macro (or function) call code as input in the form of a rewrite-clj node, and can:

- Transform the code to teach clj-kondo about its effect.
- Inspect call arguments and emit findings about them.

#### Transformation

As an example, let's take this macro:

``` clojure
(ns mylib)
(defmacro with-bound [binding-vector & body] ,,,)
```

Users can call this macro like so:

``` clojure
(require '[my-lib])
(my-lib/with-bound [a 1 {:with-bound/setting true}] (inc a))
```

Clj-kondo does not recognize this syntax and will report the symbol `a` as
unresolved. If the macro didn't expect an option map in the third position of
the binding vector, we could have used `:lint-as {my-lib.with-bound
clojure.core/let}`, but unfortunately that doesn't work for this macro. We will
now write a hook that transforms the call into:

``` clojure
(let [a 1] {:with-bound/setting true} (inc a))
```

It is not important that the code is rewritten exactly according to the
macroexpansion. What counts is that the transformation rewrites into code that
clj-kondo can understand.

This is the code for the hook:

``` clojure
(ns hooks.with-bound
  (:require [clj-kondo.hooks-api :as api]))

(defn with-bound [{:keys [:node]}]
  (let [[binding-vec & body] (rest (:children node))
        [sym val opts] (:children binding-vec)]
    (when-not (and sym val)
      (throw (ex-info "No sym and val provided" {})))
    (let [new-node (api/list-node
                    (list*
                     (api/token-node 'let*)
                     (api/vector-node [sym val])
                     opts
                     body))]
      {:node new-node})))
```

Note, in order to prevent false positive `redundant-let` warning, when using
this macro within actual let block, instead of using `(api/token-node 'let)`
we're using `(api/token-node 'let*)`. Clj-kondo will lint `let*` syntactically
the same, but won't report it as a nested `let`.

This code will be placed in a file `hooks/with_bound.clj` in your `.clj-kondo`
directory.

To register the hook, use this configuration:

``` clojure
{:hooks {:analyze-call {my-lib/with-bound hooks.with-bound/with-bound}}}
```

The symbol `hooks.with-bound/with-bound` corresponds to the file
`.clj-kondo/hooks/with-bound.clj` and the `with-bound` function defined in
it. Note that the file has to declare a namespace corresponding to its directory
structure and file name, just like in normal Clojure.

An analyze-call hook function receives a `:node` in its argument map. This is a
rewrite-clj node representing the hooked Clojure macro (or function) call code
clj-kondo has found in the source code it is linting. The hook uses the
`clj-kondo.hooks-api` namespace to validate then rewrite this node into a new
rewrite-clj node:

1. The `with-bound` hook function checks if the call has at least a `sym` and `val`
node. If not, it will throw an exception, which will result in a clj-kondo warning.

2. As a last step, the hook function constructs a new node using `api/list-node`,
`api/token-node` and `api/vector-node`. This new node is returned in a map under
the `:node` key.

Now clj-kondo fully understands the `my-lib/with-bound` macro and you will no
longer get false positives when using it. Moreover, it will report unused
bindings and will give warnings customized to this macro.

</p>

#### Custom lint warnings

Analyze-call hooks can also be used to create custom lint warnings, without
transforming the original rewrite-clj node.

This is an example for re-frame's `dispatch` function which checks if the
dispatched event used a qualified keyword.

``` clojure
(ns hooks.re-frame
  (:require [clj-kondo.hooks-api :as api]))

(defn dispatch [{:keys [:node]}]
  (let [sexpr (api/sexpr node)
        event (second sexpr)
        kw (first event)]
    (when (and (vector? event)
               (keyword? kw)
               (not (qualified-keyword? kw)))
      (let [{:keys [:row :col]} (some-> node :children second :children first meta)]
        (api/reg-finding! {:message "keyword should be fully qualified!"
                           :type :re-frame/keyword
                           :row row
                           :col col})))))
```

The hook uses the `api/sexpr` function to convert the rewrite-clj node into a
Clojure s-expression, which is easier to analyze. In case of an unqualified
keyword we register a finding with `api/reg-finding!` which has a `:message`,
and `:type`. The `:type` should also occur in the clj-kondo configuration with a
level set to `:info`, `:warning` or `:error` in order to appear in the output:

``` clojure
{:linters {:re-frame/keyword {:level :warning}}
 :hooks {:analyze-call {re-frame.core/dispatch hooks.re-frame/dispatch}}}
```

Additionally, the finding has `:row` and `:col`,
derived from the node's metadata to show the finding at the appropriate
location.

### Clojure code as rewrite-clj nodes

If you develop a hook you will likely need some familiarity with rewrite-clj node structure.
A couple of examples might help:

`(my-macro 1 2 3)` becomes:

- a list node with `:children`:
  - token node `my-macro`
  - token node `1`
  - token node `2`
  - token node `3`

`(my-lib/with-bound [a 1 {:with-bound/setting true}] (inc a))` becomes:

- a list node with `:children`
  - token node `my-lib/with-bound`
  - vector node with `:children`
    - token-node `a`
    - token-node `1`
    - map node with `:children`
      - keyword node `:with-bound/setting`
      - token node `true`
  - list node
    - token node `inc`
    - token node `a`

Clj-kondo uses a different approach to metadata than the original rewrite-clj
library. Metadata nodes are stored in the `:meta` key on nodes correponding to
the values carrying the metadata:

`^:foo ^:bar []` becomes:

- a vector node with `:meta`
  - a seq of nodes with:
    - keyword node `:foo`
    - keyword node `:bar`

### Example Hooks

- rewrite-cljc-playground: [import-vars-with-mod](https://github.com/lread/rewrite-cljc-playground/commit/09882e1244a8c12879ef8c1e6872724748e7914b)

More examples of hooks can be found in the [examples](../examples)
directory. Take a look at the [Rum](../examples/rum) and
[Slingshot](../examples/slingshot) configuration.

### Tips and tricks

Here are some tips and tricks for developing hooks.

#### Debugging

For debugging the output of a hook function, you can use `println` or `prn`. To
get a sense of what a newly generated node looks like, you can use `(prn
(api/sexpr node))`.

#### Performance

Less code to process will result in faster linting. If only one hook is used in
certain files and another hook is used in other files, divide them up into
multiple files and namespaces. If the hooks use common code, you can put that in
a library namespace and use `require` to load it from each hook's namespace.

To test performance of a hook, you can write code which triggers the hook and
repeat that expression `n` times (where `n` is a large number like
1000000). Then lint the file with `clj-kondo --lint` and measure
timing. The `time` macro is also available within hooks code.

### Clojurists Together

The initial work on hooks was sponsored by [Clojurists
Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) as part of their [Summer of
Bugs](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/announcing-summer-of-bugs/)
program.

## Output

### Print results in JSON format


``` shell
$ clj-kondo --lint corpus --config '{:output {:format :json}}' | jq '.findings[0]'
{
  "type": "invalid-arity",
  "filename": "corpus/nested_namespaced_maps.clj",
  "row": 9,
  "col": 1,
  "level": "error",
  "message": "wrong number of args (2) passed to nested-namespaced-maps/test-fn"
}
```

Printing in EDN format is also supported.

### Print results with a custom format

``` shell
$ clj-kondo --lint corpus --config '{:output {:pattern "::{{level}} file={{filename}},line={{row}},col={{col}}::{{message}}"}}'
::warning file=corpus/compojure/core.clj,line=2,col=19::Unsorted namespace: foo
```

The custom pattern supports these template values:

| Template Variable | Notes                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `{{filename}}`    | File name                                                 |
| `{{row}}`         | Row where linter violation starts                         |
| `{{col}}`         | Column where linter violation starts                      |
| `{{level}}`       | Lowercase level of linter warning, one of info,warn,error |
| `{{LEVEL}}`       | Uppercase variant of `{{level}}`                          |
| `{{message}}`     | Linter message                                            |

### Include and exclude files from the output

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint "$(clj -Spath)" --config '{:output {:include-files ["^clojure/test"]}}'
clojure/test.clj:496:6: warning: redundant let
clojure/test/tap.clj:86:5: warning: redundant do
linting took 3289ms, errors: 0, warnings: 2

$ clj-kondo --lint "$(clj -Spath)" --config '{:output {:include-files ["^clojure/test"] :exclude-files ["tap"]}}'
clojure/test.clj:496:6: warning: redundant let
linting took 3226ms, errors: 0, warnings: 1
```

### Show progress bar while linting

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint "$(clj -Spath)" --config '{:output {:progress true}}'
.................................................................................................................
cljs/tools/reader.cljs:527:9: warning: redundant do
(rest of the output omitted)
```

### Output canonical file paths

The config `'{:output {:canonical-paths true}}'` will output canonical file
paths (absolute file paths without `..`). This also shows the full path of a jar
file when you lint a classpath.

``` shellsession
$ clj-kondo --lint corpus --config '{:output {:canonical-paths true}}'
/Users/borkdude/dev/clj-kondo/corpus/cljc/datascript.cljc:8:1: error: datascript.db/seqable? is called with 2 args but expects 1
(rest of the output omitted)
```
